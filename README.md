# CNN-Based-AI-System-for-Lung-Cancer-Detection-and-Diagnosis
## Dataset
We provide results on the Iraq-Oncology Teaching Hospital/National Center for Cancer Diseases (IQ-OTH/NCCD) lung cancer dataset. The data is available on kaggle.   
## Description
This work presents a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for lung cancer (LC) detection using CT scans. The model leverages data augmentation and preprocessing to enhance sensitivity and specificity, and achieves a classification accuracy of 99.39% on the IQ-OTH/NCCD dataset. Comparative results show that it outperforms several existing deep learning and hybrid approaches, highlighting its potential for reliable and accurate LC diagnosis in clinical applications.
